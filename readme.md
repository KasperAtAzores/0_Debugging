# Debugging & debuggers
This note will try to give an overview of how to use a debugger, and how they function internally.

To undestand a debugger for a specific programming language you need to understand the run-time structures of that programming language. I will focus on the object oriented programming languages based on a call stact and an object heap.

In fall 2017 I wrote a note in connection with a class I taught, so I will not redo that work. The note is based on Java, Netbeans, and a magnificient tool named pythontutor.com.
